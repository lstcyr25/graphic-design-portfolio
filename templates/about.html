                <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
                <p>
                    Iâ€™m a graphic design student at Polk State College working towards an Associateâ€™s degree. Art has been a strong interest of mine throughout
                    my entire life which expanded into a passion for design after graduating high school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Iâ€™ve grown from learning simple tools in Photoshop to working with
                    other programs and creating projects that truly mean something to me.
                    I still have more to learn and I am eager to do so. As I grow my abilities I hope to explore career options that will allow me to apply my skills to
                    something even greater and continue to learn more.
                </p>
